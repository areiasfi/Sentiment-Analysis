Project 1

The goal of this project was to design a classifier to use for sentiment analysis of product reviews. The training set consists of reviews written by Amazon customers for various food products. The reviews, originally given on a 5 point scale, have been adjusted to a +1 or -1 scale, representing a positive or negative review, respectively.
